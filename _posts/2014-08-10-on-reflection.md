It's been an amazing, life changing year yadda yadda blah blah blah. New start. Old job left behind. I was a corporate lawyer, and now I'm a software developer. I get to be creative, make stuff, break stuff and do the things I want to do. IANAL (anymore). 

I have an awesome wife and amazing daughter. My family supports me. It's great and i'm privileged to be able to jump from one career when married with a kid and start back at the bottom in another. I don't want to come across as boastful or arrogant. I carry imposter syndrome around like an albatross. I'm still at the very beginning of becoming a software developer, but I love making things. Or making things better. I've been given an amazing chance and work with an excellent team. I'm very lucky. 

Now that's out of the way, a bit on the journey so far. 

### Leaving the law 

It took about 10 years to get to where I stood last summer. 6 years of University, years out teaching and researching Intellectual Property Law. 2 years as a trainee and I was a year into qualification, working for one of the top firms in the country. My next move, a proverbial [Barnes Opening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_Opening) was to quit. Rewinding a few steps, my wife and I had just had a daughter and we were just over a year married. People looked at me like I was crazy and, to be honest, it was. I had a great job, good salary and great options for the future as a lawyer. It's just that, I hated it. The monotony of the work, the lack of a real challenge, continually spending time doing work thar made little to no difference for large corporate clients that didn't really care about anything other than the bottom line. Passé, cliché - undeniably true. 

I quite. Stomped on the last 10 years - erased. Start again. Pursue a passion - build stuff, make stuff. Like when you were 8 years old and glued shit together to make a rocket. Or Tracy Island like they did on Blue Peter. But you know, grown up. With code. 

### A plan...of sorts
